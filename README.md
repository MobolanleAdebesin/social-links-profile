## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a more modern way to ensure that my projects use the content-box model so that component widths display as expected.

```css
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*,
*:before,
*:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm interested in learning about alternatives for importing fonts into my projects. I know it's possible to use a CDN which would result in less verbose code in my css files, but I want to understand the trade offs of different approaches.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/) - This helped me for with box-sizing. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
